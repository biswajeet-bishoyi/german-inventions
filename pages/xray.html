        <h2>Wilhelm Roentgen & The Discovery of X-rays</h2>
        <img src="../images/xray-discovery.jpg" alt="Wilhelm Roentgen's X-ray discovery">
        <p>In 1895, the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen made a groundbreaking discovery that would forever change the world of medicine. During his experiments with cathode rays, Roentgen noticed a mysterious, invisible radiation that could penetrate solid objects. He called this radiation "X-rays" because its nature was initially unknown. His discovery made it possible to see inside the human body without the need for surgical procedures. This led to the development of modern medical imaging and revolutionized diagnostic methods in hospitals worldwide. The first X-ray image showed the hand of his wife, Bertha, clearly revealing her bones and a ring—a picture that astonished the medical community.</p>
        <p>The invention of X-rays had profound effects not only on medicine but also on many other fields of science and technology. In material testing, X-rays allow for the examination of metals and materials for internal defects without causing damage. In archaeology and art history, they are used to analyze hidden layers of paintings or to study ancient manuscripts. X-rays also play a crucial role in the aerospace industry, ensuring the quality of components used in aviation and space exploration. Roentgen’s discovery earned him the first-ever Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901, and his pioneering work continues to be the foundation for many modern technologies that make our lives safer and more efficient.</p>
